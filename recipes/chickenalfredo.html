        <h3 class="body2" id="ingre">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="body2" id="ul-list">
            <li>16 ounces dry fettuccine patsta</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 jar of Ragu Alfredo sauce</li>
        <h3 class="body2" id="instru">Instructions</h4>
        <ol class="body2" id="ol-list">
             <li> <strong>Make the noodles.</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</li>
             <li> <strong>Make the chicken.</strong> Season the chicken breasts with the italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it's shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.</li>
             <li>Combine the noodles, chicken, and sauce and serve! <strong>Be careful, it may be Hot!</strong> </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
